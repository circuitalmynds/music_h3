NOTE: Harry BIDGOOD (born in London in 1898, died in London in 1957) – English dance band leader and musical director for numerous films, including several starring George Formby. Bidgood was taught the piano at an early age by his father who was a composer. As teenager he went on to the Variety stage as a solo pianist, and also played at cinemas in the 'silent' days. He served in the British Army orchestra during WW1, and in the early 1920s he was contracted as pianist at the Old Vic, until he formed the dance-band with which he spent over three years at the Piccadilly Hotel. During the mid to late 1920s Harry Bidgood led the in-house studio band for Vocalion Records in England (which emerged from the American Vocalion and was acquired by Brunswick in 1925). In 1927 Vocalion decided to discontinue its namesake label, replacing it with the new Broadcast label. Broadcast records were eight inch (later on, nine inch) records which, through the use of slightly narrower grooves, offered the same playing time as standard sized 10 inch records. Because of the label name, Bidgood called his band Harry Bidgood's Broadcasters. He also recorded as the New York Nightbirds, Ciro’s Club Band, The Manhattan Melody Makers, Al Benny’s Broadway Boys and in beginning of the 1930s - Primo Scala and his Accordion Band. He also broadcast frequently on BBC and in 1933 led a quartet in a series of pioneering BBC television transmission. As director of Primo Scala's Accordion Band he remained active until just before his death in Nov 1957.
