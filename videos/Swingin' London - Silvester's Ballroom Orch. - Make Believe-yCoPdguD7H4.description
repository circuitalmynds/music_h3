----------------------------------

Victor Marlborough Silvester, (1900 -- 1978) was a English dancer, composer and dance band leader whose records sold 75 million copies from the 1930s through to the 1980s, and a significant figure in the development of ballroom dance during the first half of the 20th century. Silvester was born the second son of a vicar in Wembley, Middlesex. He was educated at Ardingly College, St. John's School, Leatherhead and John Lyon School, Harrow from all of which he absconded. In 1915 he enlisted in the British Army during the Ist WW. (He was only 15 years old and had to lie about his age in order to get in.) His true age was not discovered until he was wounded in 1917 and discharged. After the war he was admitted to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst but decided it was not for him. He also studied music at Trinity College, but his his interests had meanwhile turned to dancing. He was one of the first post-war English dancers to feature the full Natural Turn in the Slow Waltz, an innovation which was a factor in his winning the first World Standard Ballroom Dancing Championship in 1922. He was a founder member of the Ballroom Committee of the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing which codified the theory and practice of Ballroom Dance (now known as the International Style) and published the first book embodying the new standards in 1928 (Modern Ballroom Dancing, which was a bestseller and has remained in print through many editions) By the early 1930s his teaching had become famous and he had taught some of the top celebrities of the day, among whom was Estelle Thompson (better known as Merle Oberon).
The lack of what he felt were adequate records for dancing led Silvester in 1935 to form his own five-piece band, later enlarged and named Victor Silvester and his Ballroom Orchestra. The Silvester band always had a distinctive sound, achieved by an unusual line-up including, as well as the usual rhythm section, alto saxophone, a lead solo violin (for many years usually Oscar Grasso), and two pianos, one taking turn in solos and the other maintaining an improvised continuo in the background throughout every piece, which Silvester called his "lemonade". Unlike most British dance bands, there were no vocals. Silvester did not play but stood in front of his orchestra in white tie and tails. His jaunty way with a catchy tune ensured the appeal of his records went wider than dancing enthusiasts .
By the end of 1950s he was the most successful dance band leader in British musical history. His BBC show Dancing Club lasted 17 years. He also presented a weekly request programme on the BBC Overseas Service which ran until 1975. After his death, his orchestra remained in existence under his son's direction until the 1990s.
